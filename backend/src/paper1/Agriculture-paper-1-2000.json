The government should buy up part of the supply when output is in excess, store \nthis surplus and later sells it to the consumer in times of reduced supply. \n-\tStabilization fund. The government through marketing boards can maintain or increase prices of \nagricultural products, depending on world market prices. If profits are made, they are saved and \nused to stabilize prices and incomes of the farmers. \n-\tA variety of agricultural activities should be introduced e.g. crop farming, poultry, animal \nhusbandry etc. to reduce over dependence on one or a few sources of agricultural income in a \nbid to stabilize farmers\u2019 income. \n-\tEncourage formation of cooperatives to bargain fair prices \n-\tIntroduce irrigation schemes to ensure continuous supply of agricultural products. \n6 digitalteachers.co.ug \n\n-\tStability in prices of agriculture can also be attained by improving transport system to enable \neasy marketing \n-\tThere is a need to improve, develop and expand storage facilities to accommodate excess \noutput in agriculture. \n-\tPrice control. Government should establish the minimum and maximum prices for agricultural \noutput. \n-\tMarket expansion. Government should expand agricultural output market through economic \nintegrations \n-\tencourage further diversification of agriculture \n-\tEncourage  processing to increase value and shelf-life \n-\tDissemination of marketing information to the farmers. \n32.(a) Give six consideration that should be made by a farmer when selecting and preparing seeds for \nplanting. (06marks) \n-\tShould be viable \n-\tShould be disease \n-\tShould be free from mechanical damage \n-\tShould be mature \n-\tShould have appropriate size to ensure enough food reserve \n-\tShould be free from contamination \n-\tShould be of desired genetic make up \n-\tShould be plump i.e. well-formed and not wrinkled \n(b)Four advantages of planting crops on ridges. (04marks) \n-\tImproved weed control: ridges reduce weed density \n-\tWarmer soil temperature: the ridges warm up sooner because the residue from the previous \ncrop settle between them \n-\tBetter soil moisture \n-\tBetter aeration \n-\tErosion control: ridges act like mini terraces, reducing soil erosion \n-\tReduced herbicide costs due to the effective weed control \n-\tControlled traffic patterns: this system helps in managing traffic patterns, reducing soil \ncompaction \n33.(a)  Describe four precautions to be taken when air seasoning timber (04marks) \n-\tProtection of timber from termites, insects and rodents to prevent destruction \n-\tDrying of the timber indoors to allow uniform drying to prevent cracking and shrinkage \n-\tProtection from water and excessive humidity to prevent them from rotting and hasten drying \n-\tHeaped on leveled ground to prevent from wrapping and gap left to allow air circulation. \n-\tPreservation of handling equipment to prevent rotting \n7 digitalteachers.co.ug \n\n(b) State three advantages and three disadvantages of using wood to make farm structures. \n(06marks) \nAdvantages of using wood to make farm structures\n-\tIt is relatively cheap \n-\tDurable \n-\tEasily worked with simple tools \n-\tLess labour is required to work with wood \nDisadvantages of using wood to make farm structures\n-\tEasily catch fire\n-\tRequire treatment to last\n-\tLow strength\n-\tEasily affected by weather\n34.(a)  Explain the meaning of the following terms (02 marks each) \n(i) \tseed viability \nSeed viability refers to the ability of a seed to germinate and develop into a healthy \nseedling under favorable conditions.\n(ii) \tseed dormancy \nSeed dormancy is defined as the inability of a viable seed to germinate under\nconditions favorable for germination. \n(b) Describe one method you would use to determine the viability of a sample of seeds. (03marks) \n-\tGermination Test: Place a specific number of seeds (e.g., 100) on a moist paper towel, fold it,\nand place it in a plastic bag. Keep it in a warm place and check after a few days to see how many\nseeds have sprouted. \n-\tWater Test: Place seeds in a container of water. Viable seeds will sink, while non-viable seeds\nwill float. \n-\tExcised Embryo Test: This involves removing the embryo from the seed and placing it in \na nutrient solution to see if it grows. \n-\t Chemical Test: Some seeds can be tested using chemicals that react with living tissues, \nindicating viability. \noViable seeds soaked in 0.1% tetrazolium salt solution and left for 24 hours will \nhave their  embryo stained red. \noViable seeds decolorize warm potassium permanganate solution \n-\tThe electrical conductivity test measures the leachate\u2019s conductivity when seeds are soaked in \nwater, providing an indirect assessment of seed viability. \n(c)Explain the significance of seed dormancy (03marks) \n-\nSurvival in adverse conditions\n8 digitalteachers.co.ug \n\n\n-\n-\nAllows seeds and fruits to disperse \nArtificial storage: Seed dormancy allows agricultural seeds to be stored artificially.\n35.A cow produces milk after calving. It is then dried out before the next calving \t(a)(i) Describe two methods by which drying-off is achieved \n-\nIncomplete milking: this involves milking  the cow  half way its production capacity so that the\nremaining milk  in the udder  exerts  pressure  on the  milk secreting  cells which will stop secreting  milk.\n-\nIntermittent milking: the cow is milked at intervals of days and later left completely after 5 days\nor more. \n-\nCessation Milking: this is when milking stopped once for all.  It causes a lot of pain to the animal\nand can easily result into mastitis \n-\nDry cow therapy: Here antibiotics are included in feeds which will control mastitis.\n(ii) Explain how drying \u2013off benefits the cow. (03marks) \n-Allow the cow to restore udder tissues before getting  back to lactation -Allow the cow to replace  the minerals depleted during lactation -To maintain a high future  milk yield  in the next lactation \n-Enable the cow  to gain weight  before delivering \n-To ensure high quality colostrum at birth \n-To enable treatment of sick cow \n(b)Colostrum is produced by the cow for 3 to 4 days after calving. \n(i) State two ways in which colostrum in the first few days differ from ordinary milk. (02marks) \n-Colostrum is filled with immunoglobins to boost your baby's immune system and protect it \tfrom illness. \n-Colostrum has two times as much protein. \n-Colostrum has four times as much zinc. \n-Colostrum is lower in fat and sugar so it's easier to digest. -Colostrum is thicker and more yellow. \n(ii) State two benefits to the calf of being given colostrum the first few days of its life. (02marks) \n-Calves obtain passive immunity \n-reduces chances of diseases \n-Reduced death rates \n-Better growth rates \n9 digitalteachers.co.ug \n\n-Improved lifetime productivity and fertility \nPlease obtain free downloadable notes of general paper, biology, economics, geography etc. from \ndigitalteachers.co.ug website \nThanks \nDr. Bbosa Science \n10 digitalteachers.co.ug": null}
