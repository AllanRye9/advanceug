                    We are a non-profit organization committed to providing free access to
                    educational resources such as past papers, textbooks, and learning tools.
                    These materials are sourced from qualified teachers and experienced students
                    to create a centralized platform that supports learners in their academic
                    journey. Our goal is to help students excel in UNEB examinations by
                    offering high-quality resources at their fingertipsâ€”completely free of charge.
